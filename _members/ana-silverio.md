Ana Silverio (she/her/ella) is a first generation Mexican-American marine conservation biologist. 
Prior to her position at UNH, she graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor's in Biology with a concentration in Marine and Freshwater Science from the University of Texas at Austin.
At UT Austin, Ana worked in a fisheries ecology lab where her research focused on age and growth studies of the Red Drum fishery off the Texas Gulf Coast.
While working with the Red Drum fishery, she developed otolith polishing protocols for future lab use and collaborated on growth modeling simulations using R Studio.
Most of Ana's interests lie in fisheries ecology, fisheries management and marine conservation.
She hopes to implement both quantitative tools and marine social science to address these ocean issues. 
Ana is passionate about outreach and promoting diversity and inclusion in marine science and is currently an active member of [Minorities in Shark Sciences](https://www.misselasmo.org/) an organization committed to encouraging women of color to pursue a career in shark sciences.
With MISS, she helps on membership engagement and on the scheduling committee for a virtual joint conference for the marine science BIPOC community.
Outside of her scientific interests, Ana loves to go hiking, watching soccer, live music, catching Pok√©mon or hanging out with her dog Willow!
